    <li>1 tbsp honey</li>
    <li>10g (~3/4tbsp) butter</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Prep Work</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Wash all produce</li>
            <li>Peel and dice the two onions</li>
            <li>Grate the carrot, 1/2 apple, and ginger</li>
            <li>Peel and mince the garlic cloves</li>
            <li>Peel and grate ginger</li>
            <li>Remove fat from raw beef and cut the remaining chunks
                into equal, bite-sized pieces</li>
        </ul>
    
    <li>Make the Onion Mix</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a tbsp of vegetable oil in a medium pan</li>
            <li>Put onions in pan and cook over low heat until
                softened (approximately 10 minutes)</li>
            <li>Increase heat to medium and cook until onion begins
                turning golden color, stirring occasionally. The 
                longer you fry them, the more flavor they'll add to
                the curry, but you don't want to caramelize them</li>
            <li>Add minced garlic, grated carrot, ginger, and apple
                to mix and combine</li>
            <li>Cook for 2 minutes, then remove from heat and set 
                aside</li>
            <p>Since the onion cooks for a while, you can cook the 
                beef (step three) while the onion softens, but be
                careful to not let either burn.</p>    
        </ol>
    
    <li>Cook the Beef</li>
        <p>Take the trimmed beef cubes and throw them into a clean
            pan. Cook over medium heat until the sides are all
            browned. Remove from heat and set aside. You don't 
            have to worry about the beef being too rare; you'll be
            simmering it in the curry for a long time before it's 
            finished. You should be careful to not burn any sides, 
            though. You'll want the beef pieces to be as tender as 
            possible in the final dish.</p>
        
    <li>Make the Spice Mix</li>
        <p>You'll definitely want to have your measuring spoons and 
            various spices handy for this step. You can modify this
            however you want. To make the spice mix, take another 
            clean pan and do the following:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Add flour to the pan over medium heat. Once you start
                smelling the flour cooking a little, you're getting 
                pretty close.</li>
            <li>Once flour is sufficiently heated and/or starting to
                turn golden, add all other spices (2 tsp ground cumin,
                2 tsp ground coriander, 2 tsp ground tumeric, 1 tsp ground
                cardamom, 1 tsp ground cinnamon, 1/2 hot chili powder, 1/2
                tsp ground nutmeg, 1/4 ground clove, and 1/4 tsp black
                pepper)</li>
            <li>Combine spices and cook over medium hear for 2 minutes
                or until fragrant</li>
            <li>Turn off heat</li>
        </ol>

    <li>Combine and Simmer</li>
            <p>Now that you've prepared all the disparate components
                of the curry, it's time to put it all together and make the 
                curry itself. Since curry behaves kind of like a stew at this
                point, you can add any additional solid veggies you want during 
                this step. I opted to stick with the original recipe, which did
                not include any additional veggies, but I think next time I'll
                try some chips.</p>
            <p>You'll want a heavy-based pan that has a lid.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a clean, deep, and wide pan over medium heat</li>
            <li>Add spice mix, onion mix, and beef. Stir until
                combined</li>
            <li>Add red wine, beef stock, and the bay leaf. Stir</li>
            <li>Bring to a light boil</li>
            <li>Lower heat to just warm enough to keep a light boil.
                Cover with lid and simmer for 90 minutes to 2 hours. 
                Check on it and stir every so often. If the curry lowers
                in the pan too much during its simmering, you can add a little 
                bit of water</li>
        </ol>
    
    <li>Finish It Off!</li>
        <p>Now that the curry is cooked and the beef is likely ready to fall
            apart when you bite into it, you just have to add a few more pieces 
            to the puzzle to complete the experience. During this final stretch,
            you should also prep the rice to go along with the curry.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove lid</li>
            <li>Add instant coffee (1 tsp), chocolate (10 g or ~1 tbsp), plain 
                yogurt (75 g or 1/4 cup), honey (1 tbsp), and Worcestershire sauce 
                (1 tbsp)</li>
            <li>Stir and simmer uncovered for 15 minutes</li>
        </ol>
        <p>While the curry finishes and thickens with the new ingredients, make
            the rice. Heat a tablespoon of butter with a little bit of grated 
            ginger over medium heat. Once butter is melted and ginger is fragrant,
            add rice and water, bring to a boil, stir, then reduce heat and let it 
            simmer, covered until all the water is gone. After it's finished, fluff
            with a fork, season lightly with salt, remove from heat (leaving
            it covered until you're ready to serve.)
        </p>
        
        <p>After the 15 minutes are up:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Turn off curry's heat</li>
            <li>Remove bay leaf from curry</li>
            <li> Stir in butter until melted</li>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ol>
    
    <li>Plate It and Enjoy!</li>
        <p>Now that the curry and rice are finally finished, it's time to enjoy the 
            fruits of your labor!</p>
