<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is an All-American classic that never fails, a nice 
    juicy burger!</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fine dry bread crumbs</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil
            grate</li>
        <li> Whisk together egg, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl.
            Add ground beef and bread crumbs and mix with your hands
            or a fork until well blended. Form into four 3/4-inch-thick
            patties.</li>
        <li>Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8
            minutes per side, or to desired doneness. An instant-read 
            thermometer inserted into the center should read at least
            160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
